# TaxiBot

The primary goal of this project is the development of a bluetooth 4-Wheel Airplane Taxi Bot, to showcase basic maneuvers and controls through the integration of software (android app) and hardware (Arduino board and chips) components. Commencing with the assembly of the electronic circuit utilizing an Arduino proto-board and employing precision point-to-point soldering techniques, the project culminated in the successful execution of remote control functionalities such as speech recognition, accelerometer and manual scroll stick via the android application. This innovative solution showcases a seamless integration of hardware and software, embodying a professional and meticulously engineered approach towards achieving a high-performance 4-Wheel Airplane Taxi Bot. For full documentation and showcase, refer to the `TaxiBot Report`.
